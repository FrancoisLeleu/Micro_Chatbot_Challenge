We have implemented the following functions to our bot :
========================================================
- on loading of the page, the bot welcomes the user with a random greeting message, then, he ask the user "how do you feel today?".
- The user can reply freely, and the bot need to check in the response if he can find a "yes" or a "no":
- if the script find a "yes" in the message, the bot answers with a random sentence from a specific set of three
- if the script find a "no" in the message, the bot answers with a random sentence from a specific set of three
- if the script cannot find a "yes" or a "no" in the message, the bot answer "__ACTUAL ANSWER__"
- if the script cannot find a "yes" or a "no" in the message after three attempts, the bot begins to be mad and use "__ACTUAL ANSWER__"
- After this answer, the bot has finish his routine. He says "__ACTUAL ANSWER__" to the user and the textarea go to disabled mode.
